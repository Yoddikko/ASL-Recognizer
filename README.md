# ASL Recognizer
## A simple app that analyses and recognises the alphabet in sign language using machine learning
I trained the model with [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) dataset of about 80,000 images depicting the american alphabet in sign language.
The computer trained the model for about 24h and I got pretty accurate results.
